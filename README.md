The covid 19 pandemic crucially affected the economical sector as well as the health sector. Because of the lockdowns and travel restrictions people had to avoid physical shopping and this was very critical for sales sector since physical sales are vital for their sales. As a result of this situation consumers as well as the merchandizers had to opt for online sales. 
Unlike physical shopping where the customer is free to select anything according to his/her personal taste, economical standard etc., online shopping is somewhat difficult. If the merchandizer can suggest the exact service or product to the customer which he/she was planning to buy, it would be highly beneficial to both parties.  These suggestions can be made by analyzing historical data of the customer’s buying patterns, personal preferences, economic status, profession etc., using machine learning concepts.

Since we were instructed to give a solution to a real-world problem using machine learning concepts as our FDM project, we decided to select two problems in the sales sector.

<b>Classification Model</b>

The first real-world scenario that we identified is that an automobile company has plans to enter new markets with their existing products (P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5). In their existing market, the sales team has classified all customers into 4 segments (A, B, C, D).
Then, they performed segmented outreach and communication for different segment of customers.

This strategy has work exceptionally well for them. By analyzing historical data of customers, we can accurately predict the target customer segments for each case in the data. This will help manager to save time and money because he is able to focus on what's important and not waste his time putting unnecessary controls in place.


<b>Clustering  Model</b>

As the second problem we selected a shopping mall company has plans to increase their online sales. We can give them a better understanding about their customers by using a customer personality analysis.

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different types of customers.

Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that segment.
